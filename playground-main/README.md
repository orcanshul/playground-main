# Playground

This is an empty project that uses CMake to build C++ code. It is intended as a throw-away workspace for exploring programming concepts. Add experimental code to `main.cpp` then simply build and run. If `main.cpp` is getting too complex, you can move functions into `playground.h`/`playground.cpp` but this is entirely optional.
